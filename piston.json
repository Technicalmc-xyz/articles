When a piston is updated, it checks if it should retract or extend. If it can, it creates a block event containing its position and what action the piston should do, if the blockevent doesn't already exist (except in 1.15- where blockevents doesn't have a proper hashcode, so one block can have multiple blockevents).  Note that a piston trying to extend can fail (even if later, in the blockevent phase, it can extend) even though a retraction can't fail (because in the worst case, it retracts without pulling a block). When the block event phase starts, the game loops through the blockevent list, and executes blockevents in the order of creation (first in, first executed). When the piston executes its block event, it checks again if it can still do its action. If it is trying to push, it checks that it is powered and not blocked. If it is trying to pull, it checks if it is unpowered."}]},{"children":[{"text":""}],"type":"p"},{"children":[{"text":"Movement"}],"type":"h1"},{"children":[{"text":"A piston initiates its extension in the same tick it gets activated (tick no. 0), it replaces itself and the destination blocks of the blocks pushed with a "},{"children":[{"text":"moving piston (block 36)"}],"id":1625919453773,"type":"a","url":"https://technicalmc.xyz/article/view/moving_piston_block_36"},{"text":""},{"children":[{"text":""}],"type":"a","url":"https://technicalmc.xyz/render-post/34"},{"text":". 2 ticks later (in tick no. 2), a piston is placed back where it was before (except now it is extended) and the pushed block arrive at their positions.
