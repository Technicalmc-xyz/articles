In order to do this, the update that powers it needs to come from a moving rail (1.12 and below), a moving coral fan (1.13+)(specifically a moving block replacing the coral fan base), or a moving lit observer (works in all versions that have observers), which needs to happen before the TNT block is removed (before a block behind the tnt replace it,if there is no blocks, it can be after the moving TNT was created). \nThese specific blocks are able to update after the list of blocks to be moved is created, but before the blocks have moved.
